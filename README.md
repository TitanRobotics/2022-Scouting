2022-Scouting
=============

Configurable Scouting Application for FIRST Team 2022 Titan Robotics

TODO Evan: 
* Clone this repository onto your computer. (git clone)
* Copy your entire eclipse project into the resulting folder.
* Add, Commit, and Push everything (to the master branch)
* Update the README to explain how to "install" the project.

Really, explain how to get CSVWriter working.
Also, how to compile and execute the program.

* Compile the following in C++:

```cpp
int main() {
  return system("java -jar Scouting_2013.jar");
  }
```

When you run the .exe, the java application will start. It should get rid of the command prompt (also, it is Mac/Linux compatible).
* Start organizing your issues, here are some ideas to get started:
** Do something about the God Object
** Comment Code
** Add a configuration file
** etc...
** Look at http://github.com/TitanRobotics/2022-FRC-2013 to see how we organized issues for the final bot.
* If you want, set some milestones.

NOTE: By default, every person on Titan Robotics can edit this code, and it will be open source, so other FIRST teams can see it too.
If this is a problem, tell me, and I can put it on our secure SVN server. Accessible, but not easily shared.
